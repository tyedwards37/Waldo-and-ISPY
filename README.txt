Project: Waldo and ISPY
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: Design a program that will give the user two options of ISPY or Where's Waldo. If ISPY is selected, the user can give the name of the image with the item being searched for and the program will locate it in the larger search image. If Where's Walso is selected, the user can give the name of the search image with Waldo in it and the program will locate him, if he is there. 

Software: Python

Reason: I wanted to test my ability to design things in Fusion and thought that creating a figure with joints would provide a fun challenge since the measurements and design would neeed to be very precise in order for it to funciton properly. 

Plan: 
        1. Find an image recogniition library for Python and learn the API. 
        2. Have the program prompt the user for ISPY or Waldo.
        3. Define a program that takes text as input, finds a file by that name, and searches in another image for an instance of the input image. (ISPY)
        4. Define a program that takes text as input, identifies a programmer-defined file with an image of Waldo's face, and uses the image of the face to find an instance of Waldo within the input image. 
        5. MAYBE: Have a display of how long it took the program to find it.
